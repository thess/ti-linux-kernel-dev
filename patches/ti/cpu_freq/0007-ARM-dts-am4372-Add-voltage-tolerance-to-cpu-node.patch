Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: am4372: Add voltage-tolerance to cpu node

Allow for a voltage-tolerance so that cpufreq can adjust the voltage to
the closest acceptable voltage for an OPP rather than an exact voltage
that may or may not exist.

Tolerance value calculated from Table 5.3 in section 5.4 of AM437x
Data Manual, SPRS851, June 2014.
